# Expectation

The reader should have at least some background in Mathematics and some basic proof strategies, including proof by contradiction, proof by induction, and proof by contrapositive.

I created this site because I have learned many algorithms, but forget them without using them, or Leetcode keeps pushing the same problem sets using similar strategies to solve. In contrast, the difficulties of the weekly competition are growing to fit the intelligence of LLMs.

I wish I could return to the day when I truly appreciated the beauty of ALGORITHMS and made reasonable efforts to remember them.
