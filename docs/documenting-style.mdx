# Documenting Style

I will describe each algorithm in the following format: first, some nonsense that you can skip

## Codes

This should be the section that should be filled first; it follows my naming convention and some standard coding. It should have at least runnable Python code so that I can copy and paste efficiently.


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Java" label="Java">

```java
public void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="C++" label="C++">

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs> 

## Description (Header 1)

This section describes the core idea of the algorithm with some illustrations that help me understand.

It should have at least the following elements:

- Run time analysis in big O notation

- Memory analysis in big O notation

Some guidelines must be followed:

- It should not be the pseudocode

- It should be accompanied by examples outside of computer science so that they create a connection with your life. You can use Leetcode problem settings for this

- It should have at least one example

## Extensions

Additional resource to consider and other possible algorithms that can be combined with it, with examples

## Applications

This should be a list of problems that use the algorithm.

### Topic 1

A general description of the topic, or specified definitions used.

#### Problem 1 [Expected difficulty: A rank from 1 to 15]
