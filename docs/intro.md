# Welcome

This is a site designed for me as a reference for some algorithms. It has nothing to do with soyorin in MyGO

It is recommended to use the open-source version, but that will degrade my expectations as a clean tool for sharing algorithms and insights to computer science problems. WordPress is too heavy for this project. So I chose the Gitbook and am ready to leave it at any time.
