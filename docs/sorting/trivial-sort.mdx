# Trivial Sort

Sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science. It relates to many other problems. (useless nonsense)

## Description

Since the idea is so stupid, we will not write  code for it. In this topic page, we only consider the sorting problem in general.

### Bubble Sort

One trivial sort is bubble sort. 
The key is to swap the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

Space complexity: $O(1)$ (no extra space is used)

### Selection Sort

The key is to find the minimum element in the unsorted part and swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.

Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

Space complexity: $O(1)$ (no extra space is used)

### Counting Sort

This part is interesting because it is not a comparison-based sort.

The key is to count the number of each element and then place them in the correct position.

Time complexity: $O(n+k)$

Space complexity: $O(n+k)$ (no extra space is used)

#### Radix Sort

Radix sort is a non-comparison sort.

It is a generalization of counting sort.

It is a stable sort.

It is a in-place sort.

```python
def radix_sort(arr):
    max_digit = len(str(max(arr)))
    for digit in range(max_digit):
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(10)]
        for num in arr:
            buckets[num // (10 ** digit) % 10].append(num)
        arr = [num for bucket in buckets for num in bucket]
    return arr
```

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

void radix_sort(vector<int>& arr) {
    int max_digit = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        max_digit = max(max_digit, (int)log10(num) + 1);
    }
    for (int digit = 0; digit < max_digit; digit++) {
        vector<queue<int>> buckets(10);
        for (int num : arr) {
            buckets[num / (10 ** digit) % 10].push(num);
        }
        arr.clear();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            while (!buckets[i].empty()) {
                arr.push_back(buckets[i].front());
                buckets[i].pop();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Shell Sort

The key is to sort the elements that are far apart first, and then sort the elements that are close together.

This is my favorite sort algorithm.

Time complexity: $O(n \log n)$ (ideal, depends on the gap sequence)

The ideal gap sequence found so far experimentally is $[1,4,10,23,57,132,301,701]$

Space complexity: $O(1)$ (no extra space is used)

```python
def shell_sort(arr,gap_sequence):
    n = len(arr)
    for gap in gap_sequence:
        for i in range(gap, n):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = temp
    return arr
```
