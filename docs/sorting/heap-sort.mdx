# Heap Sort

Heap is a data structure that is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.

Usually, we use tree to represent the heap.

The parent node is always greater (or smaller) than the child node.

In python, min heap is implemented by `heapq` library.

In C++, we can use `priority_queue` to implement the heap.

## Codes

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

```python
import heapq

heap = []
heapq.heappush(heap, 1)
heapq.heappush(heap, 2)
heapq.heappush(heap, 3)

print(heapq.heappop(heap))
``` 

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="C++" label="C++">

```cpp
#include <queue>

priority_queue<int> heap;

heap.push(1);
heap.push(2);
heap.push(3);

cout << heap.top() << endl;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

# Description

Time complexity: $O(n \log n)$

The heap structure can be maintained by AVL tree.

Space complexity: $O(n)$
