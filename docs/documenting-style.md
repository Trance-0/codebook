# Documenting Style

I will describe each algorithm in the following format: first, some nonsense that you can skip

## Codes

This should be the section that should be filled first; it follows my naming convention and some standard coding. It should have at least runnable Python code so that I can copy and paste efficiently.

## Description (Header 1)

This section describes the core idea of the algorithm with some illustrations that help me understand.

It should have at least the following elements:

- Run time analysis in big O notation

- Memory analysis in big O notation

Some guidelines must be followed:

- It should not be the pseudocode

- It should be accompanied by examples outside of computer science so that they create a connection with your life. You can use Leetcode problem settings for this

- It should have at least one example

## Extensions

Additional resource to consider and other possible algorithms that can be combined with it, with examples

## Applications

This should be a list of problems that use the algorithm.
